TODO:  create token entries in the group store for each account
TODO:  since there are basically a "set" of entries that make up a
        file system, I need to come up with a way to clean up any orphaned
        entries that may occur.

Special Note:
-------------
1.  Not going to change the account blob since it will go away
    once we interface with RAX identity
2.  Since tokens are uuids, we can create a lookup entry for it and bypass the
    need for the account in command operations.
